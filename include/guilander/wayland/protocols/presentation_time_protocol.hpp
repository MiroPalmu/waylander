/// clock_gettime(). clock_gettime() is defined by POSIX.1-2001.

/// for valid timestamps tv_nsec must be in [0, 999999999].

/// and implies nothing about e.g. the timestamps used in the
/// Wayland core protocol input events.

/// The timestamp corresponds to the time when the content update
/// turned into light the first time on the surface's main output.
/// Compositors may approximate this from the framebuffer flip
/// completion events from the system, and the latency of the
/// physical display path if known.
///

/// telling which output's refresh cycle the feedback corresponds
/// to, i.e. the main output for the surface. Compositors are
/// recommended to choose the output containing the largest part
/// of the wl_surface, or keeping the output they previously
/// chose. Having a stable presentation output association helps
/// clients predict future output refreshes (vblank).
///
/// The 'refresh' argument gives the compositor's prediction of how
/// many nanoseconds after tv_sec, tv_nsec the very next output
/// refresh may occur. This is to further aid clients in
/// predicting future refreshes, i.e., estimating the timestamps
/// targeting the next few vblanks. If such prediction cannot
/// usefully be done, the argument is zero.
///
/// For version 2 and later, if the output does not have a constant
/// refresh rate, explicit video mode switches excluded, then the
/// refresh argument must be either an appropriate rate picked by the
/// compositor (e.g. fastest rate), or 0 if no such rate exists.
/// For version 1, if the output does not have a constant refresh rate,
/// the refresh argument must be zero.
///
/// The 64-bit value combined from seq_hi and seq_lo is the value
/// of the output's vertical retrace counter when the content
/// update was first scanned out to the display. This value must
/// be compatible with the definition of MSC in
/// GLX_OML_sync_control specification. Note, that if the display
/// path has a non-zero latency, the time instant specified by
/// this counter may differ from the timestamp's.

/// refresh cycle, or the output device is self-refreshing without
/// a way to query the refresh count, then the arguments seq_hi
